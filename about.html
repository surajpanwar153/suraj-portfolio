    <section>
        <p>
            I am an MBA candidate with a strong interest in business analytics, strategy,
            and data-driven decision-making. My academic and practical work focuses on
            understanding how organizations use data to improve performance, manage
            uncertainty, and make informed strategic choices.
        </p>

        <p>
            I approach business problems by first structuring them clearly, identifying
            key variables, and defining measurable outcomes. I then analyze data to uncover
            insights that can guide managerial decisions rather than just describe trends.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to analytics, I have hands-on experience in website development.
            I view technical skills as an execution layer that supports business thinking,
            allowing me to prototype ideas, build dashboards, and understand digital systems
            from an operational perspective.
        </p>

        <p>
            My long-term goal is to work in roles that combine analytics, strategy, and
            technology to help organizations make better decisions and adapt to changing
            business environments.
